Project Description:
  In this project we will be solving a common machine learning prolem i-e text classification. We will be doing this on a public
  BBC articles dataset where we will classifying different documents into five categories i-e politics, tech, entertainment, sports
  and business.
  
Purpose:
  The main thing we want to achieve in this project is to classify different articles into different catergories based on the
  most occuring keywords in them.
  
Approach:
  We will be Python as our programming language for this project. The libraries we will use are Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn,
  matplotlib. The machine learning algorithm most suitable for text classification is K-means clustering so we will be using
  that also.
